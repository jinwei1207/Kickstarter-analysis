### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
How to determine different element on the pivot table, all the instructions need to be cleared in order to make the final visible pivot table. I tried to make a blueprint on my mind before I start grab that element in to chart
## Results

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  Handling this large datesets can be a difficult task
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
